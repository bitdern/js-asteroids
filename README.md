# JavaScript Asteroids

Thanks for checking out my project! I wanted to learn more about how folks use JS to achieve some neat outcomes in the browser, and this is my first game.

## How To Play

This is exactly the game you remember... with some minor adjustments.

### Controls

- W Key = Accelerator (there is no deccelerator, FYI)
- A Key = Rotate the ship _to the left_
- D Key = Rotate the ship _to the right_
- Spacebar = Fire projectile

That's it!

### Nuances

- The asteroids do not break apart and create more asteroids like the original game - I haven't yet learned how to do that.
- If your ship hits an asteroid, and you want to start a new game, **refresh the browser window**.
- This is just JavaScript and HTML, so if you want to take the code and improve on it, please feel free to do so!
